        <h3 class="content_text">And Why It Is The Best Font Ever Invented</h3>
        <p class="content_text">Despite having been named the worst font in existance, Comic Sans actually has
            many uses. Here are a few examples of why it is actually the BEST font ever made.
            <br>
            1. Studies have shown that the irregularity of the font can actually make it more readable 
            for people who have reading difficulties.
            <br>
            2. Irregular fonts such as Comic Sans make information written in this font easier to memorise.
            <br>
            3. It has an informal appearance that is more friendly towards its audience.
            <br>
            4. It was created for Microsoft Bob. Yes, that's a real thing.
